# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

    I wanted to build a study guide for prework to get into the habit of the GitFlow. 
    I found it very useful and prepared me for bootcamp. 
    I learned how to add files like JavaScript and CSS and added useful and function code to those files.


## Installation

    N/A

## Usage

    Each section contains notes about a topic. 
    There is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
    When you open devtools you can see JavaScript running. 
    It lists topics from prework and will choose one topic for us to study first.
